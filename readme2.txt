DIAG1


Replace pth caps with smt

measure back emf from spun motors.
test clamping diode sizes

change stackup to fix impedance. add power plane capacitor to adum

Keep existing test point locations.

Use label to mark pins on power connector?

Extruder heater TP17, HB TP18, TP69, 

Add break away power connector label / panel rails

Change TVS diode on motor input to cheaper part? replace tvs back on if off?

remove third resistor from vref.

add stitching capacitor between 5v and 12 rail?

add angle mask stop slots under driver?

rename motor rail vmot. find other wires that should be renamed vmot!

move coil A to same side of driver

add series resistors to endstops and other pins where possible

switch x and y dir pins

change extension headers to accept housings
